When I was working through Pluralsight's 'Build Cross Platform React Native Apps with Exponent and Redux' course I
noticed parts of it use deprecated components. This is an attempt to rewrite it using more up to date techniques.

## Getting started

```bash
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.5/install.sh | bash
$ nvm install 6.11.4 # (latest LTS version)
$ nvm use 6.11.4
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Debugging
In emulator, press CTRL + CMD + z to launch developer tools, then select 'Debug Remote JS' to debug in Chrome
